numbers-game
============

I built this game for two reasons:

1. I wanted to learn AngularJS
2. I thought my toddler would find it fun.

I sort of succeeded on both counts.

Caveat
------

the code here won't work, because I didn't include any of the .mp3 files that provide the sound.
you'll need to record (or source) your own and stick them in subdirectories of audio and then 
modify the game model to know which voice options there are.
